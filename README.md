# Mac-Copy-Recorder
Everytime you copy text on a mac, the script will save it to a text file for later use.

## Notes

### Functionality:
-When user copys something either from key strokes (command+c) or right/control click, the copied
content will be saved to an external file.
-External file will be saved for a period of a month then deleted.
-Time stamps added to each entry in the external file.
-Create GUI that will display all the previously copied material

### Packages/Libraries:
pyperclip: for copy paste functions (pip install pyperclip)
os: for file IO (already a part of python standard library)
sys (maybe):
pynput (library): mouse and keyboard input and monitoring. pip install pynput
